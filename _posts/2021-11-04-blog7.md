For this week's blog, I will be going over my experiences with AWS. For a class, we had to choose which specific AWS service to use for a specific company. I chose a Pharmacy office.
A Pharmacy would require certain complainces for their business, so I started the process to include the HIPAA compliance stack. I found that AWS had a [HIPAA Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/compliance-hipaa/).
Before creating the compliance stack, some details must be configured such as tags and capabilities, but for my purpose I left all of these as default. My next step is to configure IAM options and set specific users and roles. 
I had a list of 11 employees with permissions and privileges kept as default. 

Overall I think this assignment helped with being familiar on how to use AWS services, and it was interesting to open the big list of tools and experiment with whicheever tool seemed useful for my company.
A tool I found to be very useful was CloudEndure, which prevents IT disasters such as data cenver failures, server corruptions. I ran an EC2 instance for this assignment as well, and although a lot of the terminology and configurations
were unfamiliar, it was still a good experience to go through the process of setting one up.
