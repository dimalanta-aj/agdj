For this week's blog, I will explain how to make a navigation bar on a website using html. The navigation bar will be featured as a drop down box, displaying each page as an option
you would like to go to. The elements that are needed include : <select>, <option>, and our attributes include: onchange. To start, our opening statement should look like this:
  <code> select id="navmenu" onchange ="window.open(this.value,'_self');"</code>. Our onchange attribute is here to trigger the page opening whenever the menu selection is changed.
"_self" specifies that when a new page is selected, it does not open in a new window but in the same tab. The next line is as follows: <code> option value='#' choose your page option</code>
  The option element is here to display the options in the selection menu. Repeat this same step as many times to satisfy all pages. All togethe it should look like this:


  <select id="navmenu" onchange="window.open(this.value,'_self');">
    <option value="#">Choose your page</option>
    <option value="page1.html">page 1</option>
    <option value="page2.html">page 2</option>
    <option value="page3.html">page 3</option>
    <option value="page4.html">page 4</option>
</select>
