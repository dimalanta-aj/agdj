For this week's blog, I will be explaining my progress with creating VPC's and subnets on AWS. I found this process simple, with simple configurations were needed. First step is two create the VPC.
To do so, simply go to VPC, and select create VPC. Initial settings are a name, and to give a IPv4 CIDR block, which I inputted with 10.0.0.0/16. The next step is to create an internet gateway,
which allows our vpc to be connected to the internet. Simply select create internet gateway and give it a name tag. Then attach that to the vpc I just created. Next is to create subnets.
For my project, a public and a private subnet is needed. Select create subnet under the VPC dashboard, name it, specify the vpc that I just created, select an availibility zone, and an IPv$ CIDR Block, which I inputted as 10.0.1.0/24.
Now I created a private subnet, using the same steps, but inputted the IPv$ CIDR block as 10.2.0/24. The next step is to set up a routing table. Select create route table under the VPC dashboard. For the public subnet, select the destination as 0.0.0.0/0, which references anywhere,
and make the target as the internet gateway that we previously created.
