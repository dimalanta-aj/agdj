For this week's blog, I will explain my attempt at loading a ReactJS app into an AWS EC2 instance.

1st step is to crate IAM roles for EC2 and AWS CodeDeploy
Next is launching the EC2 instance. My acount is currently still free-tier, so I opted for the t2.micro that is free. For the configuration, I left everything at default, except for the IAM roles, in which 
I chose the role that I created earlier. Storage and tags I left as default. The next sequence is what I am confused about: How can other users have access to my EC2 instance?
During the instance set-up, it asks to create a new key pair. An option is to add everyones IP address manually, and to send everone keys, however, I am unfamiliar with the PEM files that are also sent together with the key pairs.
When I get passed this step, the next task would be to set up CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy
