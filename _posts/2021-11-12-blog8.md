For this week's blog, I am going to use this an oppotunity to explain certain networking topics, since I have been studying them for a job interview. One of the interiew questions is
"What happens when you enter www.amazon.com?". The browser looks up IP address for the domain name in the DNS. The browser then iniiates a TCP connection with the server, and asks for an HTTP request to the server.
Ther server then handles incoming requests while sending out an HTTP response. The HTML content is then displayed, which is the content you usually see when visiting any website.
