For another class, IS 435, we learned to calculate how much space is needed for certain audio files. Although the lesson seems irrelevant, it is interesting how something like this would work.
An assignement question is as follows: How much disk space would be required to store 60 minutes of digital music that is two-channeled, and has a bandwidth of 22 kHz anf 50,000 loudness levels.
To do this we need to find the transmission speed. Since the audio file is two-channel, we have to multiply the kHz by 2 therefore: 22kHz * 2 = 44khz. 50,000 loudness levels carries 16 bits. Apply all this info into the formula:
Sampling rate * Sampling Size * Number of Channels = Transmission speed:

44,000 Hz * 16 bits * 2 = 1,408,000 bps = 1.408 Mbps.

Next we convert the 60 minutes into seconds
60 minutes = 3600 seconds.

Using the transmsission speed above, we can now calculate the amound of disk space:

1,408,000 bps * 3600 seconds = 5,068,800,00 bits = 633,600,000 Bytes = 633.6 MB

Therefore 633.6MB of disk space is required
