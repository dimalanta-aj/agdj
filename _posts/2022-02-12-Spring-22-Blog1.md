For this week's blog, I will write about my experience with creating an EC2 instance using Terraform. For our 481 project, I am responsible for setting up
our website's infrastructure with AWS, and we chose to use terraform to accomplish the goal of automation. For this task, I referenced and followed [this guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aws-build?in=terraform/aws-get-started).
The first step is to install the Terraform CLI and the AWS CLI. This allows us to use aws and terraform commands. I then created a folder for our main.tf file to go under.
I've learned some useful commands during this task, such as <code>fmt</code>, <code>validate</code>, and <code>apply</code>.I also learned the commmand <code>show</code>, which is a valuable command to display your instances current state. All of these commands are necessary to push any 
edits or configuration to the terraform file. For this example, I created one .tf file named main, as shown in the guide. In the main file, I copied the guide's terraform code, and examined each block and what it represents. The **provider** block holds the zone in which my instance is running, and in this case it is us-west-2. The **resource** block holds the instances' ami and instance type information.  Simply filling in these details within my main.tf file, and using the apply command will run my main.tf file, setting up the EC2 instance in AWS.
