For this week's blog, I will explain how to destory infrastructure through terraform, using the command destroy. We know that unmanaged infrastructure and ec2 instances can be dangerous, as
your instance may be compromised, or it can accumulate thousands of dollars of bills you must pay. The process is simple, as long as you already had terraform set up,
along with an AWS account and the AWS CLI installed. On your terminal, enter destroy, so it shows this: $ terraform destroy. Your output should display the following


<code>$ terraform destroy
