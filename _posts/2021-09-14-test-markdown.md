For this weekly blog, I am going to write about my experiences learning Jekyll and the Markdown language.
I'll admit that getting into this assignemt seemed intimidating, due to my lack of experience in github, but it is actually an exciting feeling to be hands on in this area.  
Setting up Jekyll was simple enough, by simply following the instructions set on the jekyll page on github, but apparently you must learn ruby in order to fully indulge in using jekyll. The hard part about using a previous template for Jekyll, is that to edit all the small details that were already included, I had to really look through all the files and html code. I was constantly looking for which block of html code that matched the feature I wanted to get rid of, but this also gave me great experience in working with html code and jekyll as well.

This first weekly blog assignemt really helped me in getting familiar with github and creating repositories, as an error I came across had me exploring all areas of github and tutorials, which ultimately made me more comfortable in navigating the github. This assignment also had me work with the _Markdown Language_, since that is needed in writing these blogs. I turned to [markdowntutorial.com](markdowntutorial.com), and I highly recommend our class to go through it, as it is easy but really effecient in teaching you the markdown basics.
