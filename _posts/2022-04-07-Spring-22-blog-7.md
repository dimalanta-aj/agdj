This week I will write about configuring and connecting Route 53, however, last week's blog was using an S3 bucket with route 53. This time I will connect Route53
to an EC2 instance. Firstly, check that your EC2 instance has an open port. For my project, I opened ports 80 for HTTP and 22 for SSH. Next we will create our hosted zone
on Route 53. Navigate to Route 53 and select create hosted zone. Then, enter your domain name and specify the zone has a Public hosted zone. The next step is the same as
last week's: Update your domain's registrar with Route 53's configuration. Take the domain nameservers from Route 53 and paste them to whatever registrar you've 
chosen to host your domain. Next is to create a record set on Route 53. Copy your public IP address of the EC2 instance, create a new record set, and paste the IP address
inside the value box. Create another Record set to connect your domain name to your domain name with www. in front of it. To do this, select create a record set again
but this time, select yes for alias, and then enter your domain name with www. Test the configuration by entering your domain name on the address bar.
