For this weekly blog, I am going to write about my experience with Lab 1. To start, I downloaded Ubuntu to run on a Virtual Machine. However, I had plenty of obstacles with installing Docker and the Prometheus server. Adding the command **$ docker ps**, did not work. I kept getting a "bash $ command not found error". I started from scratch and followed an online guide to install docker, and was able to install it with a few extra steps.
The next step would be to install Prometheus Server. Everything went smoothly, until the instruction to enter this command: **$./prometheus-config.file=prometheus.yml**. I kept getting the response that the prometheus file was not found. I found another online source that is supposed to fix that, by adding the **$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus** command, because apparently the error is occuring due to the prometheus files not being in the correct location. I then got an error stating that "mkdir" command was not found.
I am currently stuck and unfortunately can not proceed further. I intend to set up a meeting with a professor to help me out, but since it is due tomorrow, I might miss the deadline. I would still like to solve the lab even though no credit is due for learning purposes. I ran out of time due to travelling over the weekend and being currently really sick, but hopefully for future labs I will make better time management!
