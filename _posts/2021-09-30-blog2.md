For this weeks blog I will be writing about Lab 2, creating a dockerfile. Firstly, I installed VScode onto my Virtual Machine for convenience. To create a dockerfile, I simply went to **File>Create new file** within the docker sidebar (extension that I downloaded)
My docker file is as follows:

<p>FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt update && apt install -y wget $$ apt install -y curl 

RUN mkdir ~/packages/

RUN wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.30.0/prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz -P ~/packages/
RUN tar xvfz ~/packages/prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz --directory ~/packages/

RUN wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.2.2/node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz -P ~/packages/
RUN tar xvfz ~/packages/node_exporter-1.2.2.linux.amd64.tar.gz --directory ~/packages/</p>
