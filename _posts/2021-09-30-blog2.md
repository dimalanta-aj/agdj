For this weeks blog I will be writing about Lab 2, creating a dockerfile. Firstly, I installed VScode onto my Virtual Machine for convenience. To create a dockerfile, I simply went to **File>Create new file** within the docker sidebar (extension that I downloaded)
My docker file is as follows:

>FROM ubuntu:20.04
>
>RUN apt update && apt install -y wget $$ apt install -y curl 
>
>RUN mkdir ~/packages/
>
>RUN wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.30.0/prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz -P ~/packages/
>RUN tar xvfz ~/packages/prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz --directory ~/packages/
>
>RUN wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.2.2/node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz -P ~/packages/
>RUN tar xvfz ~/packages/node_exporter-1.2.2.linux.amd64.tar.gz --directory ~/packages/</p>

Firstly, my *docker build -t lab2* commmand was not working at all. I later found out that I had to put a period right after lab 2, so it looks like this: *docker build -t lab2 .*

 My second problem was that I had to use *~/packages* because I originally used just /packages/ but I noticed that the files were being sent to the root package file instead of the one I tried to create  
To solve that I directly untard the packages into the root package folder.  

After I was notified that the build was successful, I checked if it really did build the image by using the command *sudo docker images*, and sure enough Lab 2 was completed
